# Covid19-Tracker
Application tracks latest Covid-19 cases across the world and displays Country specific data.
This app provides users with information on coronavirus cases all around the world. The user can just look at a graph and can know the information and also by selecting a particular country the user can get to know details of that particular country like number of active cases, deaths, recovery and total cases.
Used rest api to fetch data and using a volley library displayed it.
To show graph on app I have used blackfizz library
